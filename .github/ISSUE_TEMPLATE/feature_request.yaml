        # Welcome to Gate-Operator!
        
        For a smooth issue process, try to answer the following questions.
        Don't worry if they're not all applicable; just try to include what you can :smile:
        
        If you need to include code snippets or logs, please put them in fenced code
        blocks, and if they're really long, use the [`<details>` tag][mdn-details], like:
        
        <details>
        
        <summary>Code & details examples</summary>
        
        `````markdown
        Some code written in Go:
        
        ```go
        type Manager struct {
          // FixTheBug is doing something
          FixTheBug bool
        }
        ```
        
        <details>
        
        <summary>Some really long logs</summary>
        
        ```
        ok
        ok
        ok
        SHOOT A BUG HAPPENS HERE OH NO
        ok
        ok
        done
        ```
        
        </details>
        
        `````

        Describe the feature you want, and what the motivation is.
        
        What are your use cases?  Why should we do this?
        
        Does it require a particular Kubernetes version?
        
        Is there currently another issue associated with this (use github syntax
        like `#xyz` to link to it)?
